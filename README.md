## Challenge Solutions Overview

### Challenge 1A: PDF Outline Extraction - Status: ✅ COMPLETED

- **Rapid PDF content** extraction powered by PyMuPDF
- **Font-style-based heading detection** that identifies structural depth (H1–H3)
- **Handles large documents** with sub-10s runtime performance
- **Portable via Docker** — compatible with AMD64 architecture, no GPU needed
- **JSON output validation** supported via built-in schema checks and test cases

### Challenge 1B: Persona-Driven Analysis - Status: ✅ COMPLETED

- **Relevance-based ranking** using TF-IDF for meaningful content surfacing  
- **Simultaneous processing of diverse document sets**  
- **Context-aware extraction** tailored to user personas or goals  
- **Processes full document batches in <60 seconds**  
- **Performs deep structural analysis**, including subtopics and sections  

---

## For Execution

## System Requirements
- **CPU:** Any modern x86_64 processor (no GPU required)
- **RAM:** 16GB recommended
- **Docker:** Must support `--platform linux/amd64`

### Challenge 1A: PDF Outline Extraction

> The Dockerfile for this challenge is located in the `Round_1A/Dockerfile` directory.

### Challenge 1B: Persona-Driven Analysis

> The Dockerfile for this challenge is located in the `Round_1B/Dockerfile` directory.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies

- **PyMuPDF (fitz)**: High-speed PDF parsing with font-level detail extraction  
- **Custom TF-IDF Engine**: Tailored semantic ranking for persona-driven queries  
- **JSON Schema Validation**: Guarantees structured and standards-compliant output  
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Efficient, platform-specific builds (linux/amd64)  
- **Built-in Benchmarking**: Integrated performance logging and runtime validation  

### Performance Benchmarks

- **Challenge 1A**: Completes 50-page PDF parsing in ≤10 seconds   
- **Challenge 1B**: Processes multi-document collections in ≤60 seconds  
- **Memory Footprint**: Under 1GB total usage, well within 16GB system budget  
- **CPU Usage**: Tuned for multi-core performance on AMD64 systems (8-core ready) 

---

## Solution Highlights

### Challenge 1A Innovations

- **Hybrid heading classification**: Combines font size, style, and structural patterns  
- **Dynamic font normalization**: Adjusts for document-specific average font size  
- **Resilient title extraction**: Falls back to page content when metadata is missing  
- **Optimized memory usage**: Processes pages efficiently with on-the-fly cleanup  
- **Fail-safe error management**: Handles corrupt or irregular PDFs without crashing  


### Challenge 1B Innovations

- **Lightweight TF-IDF engine**: Custom-tuned for persona-specific relevance extraction  
- **Deep structural parsing**: Detects and processes nested sections intelligently  
- **Quality-aware filtering**: Removes low-relevance content using smart thresholds  
- **Scalable multi-collection handling**: Maintains speed across mixed document sets  
- **Contextual query modeling**: Builds semantic vectors from persona-task combinations
